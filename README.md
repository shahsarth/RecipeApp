# RecipeApp

Steps to reproduce:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run "pod install" from the repositoryâ€™s main directory (I also have Package dependencies, but they should auto-load). As a sanity check, just make sure under Package Dependencies there exists: SDWebImage, SDWebImageSwiftUI, and Swift-collections.
3. Open up the xcworkspace file and build :)

Feel free to reach out to me if there are any issues reproducing the environment!
